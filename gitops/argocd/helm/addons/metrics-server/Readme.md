# Metrics Server

The Kubernetes Metric Server is a component of the Kubernetes monitoring architecture that collects and exposes cluster-level metrics such as CPU and memory usage for nodes and pods. It provides a way to monitor the resource usage of containers and nodes in the cluster, which can be used to optimize resource allocation and troubleshoot performance issues.
